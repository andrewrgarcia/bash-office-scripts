practical and document-editing scripts to have and use

## pdf_editing/images2pdf.tex

This is a LaTeX script I developed which collates several images to a single pdf file. A great tool to have if you want to save memory without the need for any fancy compression software by exporting notebook pages as images and then compiling them all into pdf . 

This is especially useful for some of the current latest versions of [GoodNotes for iOS](https://www.goodnotes.com/) (version 5.6.39 at the time), where I was able to save memory, going from 9.2 MB to 3 MB by using this algorithm instead of GoodNotes' "Export ALL / PDF Flattented"
